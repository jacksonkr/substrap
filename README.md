# substrap
A "bootstrappy" iteration based on parent div size rather than browser window size.

NOTE !! I wrote this quickly for a product and wanted to put it out there for anyone else who may need it.

The index.html has a sample example in it. it's a little buggy but this is also a beta version. I hope to clean it up soon once this project is over.
